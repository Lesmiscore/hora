# Hora

***Hora Search Everywhere!***

Hora, a approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm library, all code implemented in Rust ü¶Ä, because we think rust code is safe, high level abstraction and the speed is as fast as c++.

Hora, **`„Åª„Çâ`** in Japanese, sound like `[h≈çl…ô]`, means `Wow`, `You see!` or `Look at that!`. The name is inspired by a famous Japanese song **`Â∞è„Åï„Å™ÊÅã„ÅÆ„ÅÜ„Åü`**.

## Interface

All Index have already implement these method

```Rust
pub trait ANNIndex<E: node::FloatElement, T: node::IdxType>: Send + Sync {
    /// build up the ANN index
    ///
    /// build up index with all node which have add into before, it will cost some time, and the time it cost depends on the algorithm
    /// return `Err(&'static str)` if there is something wrong with the building process, and the `static str` is the debug reason
    fn build(&mut self, mt: metrics::Metric) -> Result<(), &'static str>;

    /// add node
    ///
    /// call `add_node()` internal
    fn add(&mut self, vs: &[E], idx: T) -> Result<(), &'static str>;

    /// add multiple node one time
    ///
    /// return `Err(&'static str)` if there is something wrong with the adding process, and the `static str` is the debug reason
    fn madd(&mut self, vss: &[&[E]], indices: &[T]) -> Result<(), &'static str>;

    /// return the index has already been built or not
    ///
    /// return `True` if the index has been built
    fn built(&self) -> bool;

    /// to rebuild the index with all nodes inside
    ///
    /// /// return `Err(&'static str)` if there is something wrong with the rebuilding process, and the `static str` is the debug reason
    fn rebuild(&mut self, _mt: metrics::Metric) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
        Err("not implement")
    }

    /// search for k nearest neighbors
    ///
    /// it only return the idx of the nearest node
    ///
    /// it require the item is the slice with the same dimension with index dimension, otherwise it will panic
    fn search(&self, item: &[E], k: usize) -> Vec<T>;

    /// return the name of the Index
    /// format like this
    /// `HNSWIndex(Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index)`
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;

    /// internal nodes' size
    fn nodes_size(&self) -> usize {
        0
    }

    /// clear all nodes and index built before
    fn clear(&mut self) {}

    /// return String of Index statistics informations
    fn idx_info(&self) -> String;

    /// return the dimension it require
    fn dimension(&self) -> usize;
}

pub trait SerializableIndex<
    E: node::FloatElement + DeserializeOwned,
    T: node::IdxType + DeserializeOwned,
>: Send + Sync + ANNIndex<E, T>
{
    /// load file with path
    fn load(_path: &str, _args: &arguments::Args) -> Result<Self, &'static str>
    where
        Self: Sized;

    /// dump the file into the path
    fn dump(&mut self, _path: &str, _args: &arguments::Args) -> Result<(), &'static str>;
}
```

# Roadmap

- [ ] Full Coverage Test
- [ ] implement a [EFANNA](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07228) to achieve faster KNN buiding
- [ ] Swift Support and also IOS/Mac OS deployment example
- [ ] R Support
- [ ] mmap file support

# Related Project and Comparison

* [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy), [ScaNN](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann): 
  * **In fact `Hora`'s implementation is strongly inspired by these lib.**
  * `Faiss` more focus on the GPU scene, and `Hora` is more light than Faiss
  * `Hora` wish to support more language, and all the thing related to speed should be implemented by Rustü¶Ä
  * `Annoy` only implement `LSH(Random Projection)` algorithm
  * `ScaNN` and `Faiss` is not easy to use, it's lack of document.
  * **ALL IN RUST** ü¶Ä

* [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus), [Vald](https://github.com/vdaas/vald), [Jina AI](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina)
  * `Milvus` and `Vald` also support multiple languages, but it serve as a service, not a lib
  * `Milvus` is built upon some libs like `Faiss`, but `Hora` is a algorithm lib, all the algo is implemented by itself
