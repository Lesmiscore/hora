# Hora

***Hora Search Everywhere!***

Hora, a approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm library, all code implemented in Rust ü¶Ä, because we think rust code is safe, high level abstraction and the speed is as fast as c++.

Hora, **`„Åª„Çâ`** in Japanese, sound like `[h≈çl…ô]`, means `Wow`, `You see!` or `Look at that!`. The name is inspired by a famous Japanese song **`Â∞è„Åï„Å™ÊÅã„ÅÆ„ÅÜ„Åü`**.

# Key Features

# Roadmap

- [ ] Full Coverage Test
- [ ] implement a [EFANNA](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07228) to achieve faster KNN buiding
- [ ] Swift Support and also IOS/Mac OS deployment example
- [ ] R Support
- [ ] mmap file support

# Related Project and Comparison

* [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy), [ScaNN](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann): 
  * **In fact `Hora`'s implementation is strongly inspired by these lib.**
  * `Faiss` more focus on the GPU scene, and `Hora` is more light than Faiss
  * `Hora` wish to support more language, and all the thing related to speed should be implemented by Rustü¶Ä
  * `Annoy` only implement `LSH(Random Projection)` algorithm
  * `ScaNN` and `Faiss` is not easy to use, it's lack of document.
  * **ALL IN RUST** ü¶Ä

* [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus), [Vald](https://github.com/vdaas/vald), [Jina AI](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina)
  * `Milvus` and `Vald` also support multiple languages, but it serve as a service, not a lib
  * `Milvus` is built upon some libs like `Faiss`, but `Hora` is a algorithm lib, all the algo is implemented by itself
